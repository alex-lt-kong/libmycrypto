# cryptographic-algorithms

* A few cryptographic algorithms for study and general usage with a focus on cryptocurrency applications such as [bitcoin-internals](https://github.com/alex-lt-kong/bitcoin-internals).

* Available algorithms are: Base32, Base58, Base64, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, RIPEMD160, SHA1, SHA256.
    * All algorhtims except Base58 are unit-tested.

* Criterion is used for unit test: `apt install libcriterion-dev libcriterion3`

* To run tests: `cd ./build && cmake ../ && make`
